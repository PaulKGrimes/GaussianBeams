# GaussianBeams

This package implements the mathematics of Gauss-Laguerre modes and objects
for holding a set of Gauss-Laguerre modes that make up paraxial Gaussian beams.

It also implements the Modified Gauss-Laguerre beams of Tuovinen and Friberg,
which relax the paraxial approximation and are able to work at higher angles
from the direction of beam propogation.
